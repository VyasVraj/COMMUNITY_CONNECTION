/**
 * Feature Types: Relationships Domain
 *
 * Interpersonal relationships connecting public.persons records (PARENT, SPOUSE, SIBLING).
 *
 * ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLES:
 * 1. PERSON != USER:
 *    Relationships link human census entities (public.persons), not auth.users accounts.
 * 2. DIRECTIONAL SEMANTICS:
 *    - PARENT: person_a_id = Parent, person_b_id = Child. Reciprocal CHILD rows are never stored.
 *    - SPOUSE: Symmetric canonical edge enforcing person_a_id < person_b_id.
 *    - SIBLING: Explicit canonical edge directly asserted (person_a_id < person_b_id).
 * 3. SOFT DELETION:
 *    - deleted_at TIMESTAMPTZ indicates logically departed or ended relationships.
